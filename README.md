# ma1805-Final-Project

Originally I was going to make a game but I didn’t know enough coding knowledge. 
This project was particularly challenging and I experienced many downs. At first my laptop wasn’t allowing images to be loaded however, I managed to get them into vs code. 
Something that was successful was the clock as I learnt how to code one and the p5js reference was incredibly useful as I have no prior coding experience at all. However, I was unable to figure out how to merge the clock and the images together.  
Learning how to make the clock took some time and therefore I did not end up figuring out how to merge the two together. However, I changed the clock to be pink.
